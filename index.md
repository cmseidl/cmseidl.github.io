## Aloha, my name is Christa Seidl. I am a conservation biologist, disease ecologist, environmental advocate and educator. I'm passionate about biodiversity conservation and managing the threats posed by infectious diseases to both wildlife and humans. 

*Current Position*: I am a Ph.D student and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow in the <a href="http://kilpatrick.eeb.ucsc.edu/">Kilpatrick Lab</a> of the <a href="https://www.eeb.ucsc.edu/">Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department</a> at the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu">University of California Santa Cruz</a>.  My research focuses on the coevolution and ecology of host-vector-parasite dynamics, with a specific focus on the evolution of avian malaria (<em>Plasmodium relictum</em>) in native and introduced bird communities on the Hawaiian Islands.

*Background*: I hold a B.Sc. in Botany and a B.Sc. Honors in Environmental Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison 2011, as well as a Certificate in Geographic Information Systems from the University of Hawaii-Maui College 2014.

If you are looking to collaborate on anything related to Hawaiian ecosystems or disease ecology, <a href="http://Chriwww.christaseidl.wordpress.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact me</a>.

<p>When I'm not chasing birds, hanging from trees, or trekking through the mud for work, I'm probably doing the same thing for fun!</p>
