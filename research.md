I have cross-disciplinary research experience in biology and ecology, with extensive experience in disease ecology, ornithology, botany, horticulture, applied ecosystem management, and science education.

My research broadly investigates the interactions between organisms and their environment, asking what are the consequences of anthropogenic change for species population dynamics?

### Current Projects:
------
1. The role of host species and species communities in avian malaria transmission (in Hawaii).

2. Effects of climate change on vector populations and pathogen transmission.

3. Population genomics of avian malaria, Plasmodium relictum (in Hawaii).

### Past Projects:
------
Role of arboreal epiphytes as climate refuges for sensitive species

Verticle distribution of arboreal herpetofauna in tropical forest canopy (in Madagascar)

Breeding phenology and population dynamics of Hawaiian Honeycreepers on Maui, Hawaii, & Kauai Islands

Wildfire Risk and Critical Habitat Assessment GIS Mapping
